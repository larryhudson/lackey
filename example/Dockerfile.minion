# Example project image — extends minion-base with project-specific tooling
#
# This shows how a target repo would define its Dockerfile.minion to add
# linters, test runners, and project dependencies. See DESIGN.md §8.1.
#
# Usage:
#   docker build -t minion-example -f example/Dockerfile.minion .

FROM minion-base:latest

# Switch to root to install packages
USER root

# Project-specific tooling
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    ruff \
    pytest

# Switch back to non-root
USER lackey
